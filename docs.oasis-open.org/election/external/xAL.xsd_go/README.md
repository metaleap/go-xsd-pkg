## Usage

```go
var (
	//	Set this to false to break a Walk() immediately as soon as the first error is returned by a custom handler function.
	//	If true, Walk() proceeds and accumulates all errors in the WalkErrors slice.
	WalkContinueOnError = true
	//	Contains all errors accumulated during Walk()s. If you're using this, you need to reset this yourself as needed prior to a fresh Walk().
	WalkErrors []error
	//	Your custom error-handling function, if required.
	WalkOnError func(error)
	//	Provides 159 strong-typed hooks for your own custom handler functions to be invoked when the Walk() method is called on any instance of any (non-attribute-related) struct type defined in this package.
	//	If your custom handler does get called at all for a given struct instance, then it always gets called twice, first with the 'enter' bool argument set to true, then (after having Walk()ed all subordinate struct instances, if any) once again with it set to false.

Provides 159 strong-typed hooks for your own custom handler functions to be
invoked when the Walk() method is called on any instance of any
(non-attribute-related) struct type defined in this package. If your custom
handler does get called at all for a given struct instance, then it always gets
called twice, first with the 'enter' bool argument set to true, then (after
having Walk()ed all subordinate struct instances, if any) once again with it set
to false.
